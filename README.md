# UiCore

This app and website is being developed by the covidsim.team for research, modeling and simulations for mitigation of COVID-19 spread in LDCs and EM/DEs.

This repo contains the common modules and core setup for the user interface and dashboards for our COVID-19 models and simulation.

We are using Angular 9.1 (thus Typescript 3.8, RxJS 6.5) with SCSS for the web frontend and Ionic 5 for Android and iOS apps. Shared components will be made into libraries using Nx.

Please check the README folder for further information regarding the app, requirements, build process and contribution guidelines.
